Description: Functions to implements random forest method for model based
    recursive partitioning. The mob() function, developed by Zeileis et al. (2008),
    within 'party' package, is modified to construct model-based decision trees based
    on random forests methodology. The main input function mobforest.analysis() takes
    all input parameters to construct trees, compute out-of-bag errors, predictions,
    and overall accuracy of forest. The algorithm performs parallel computation
    using cluster functions within 'parallel' package.
